### Research Interests

My professional research interests encompass **signal processing**,**Bayesian machine learning **and applications to biomedical engineering problems. Signal processing and machine learning form complementary fields for the design of in-the-loop medical information processing algorithms. In general, data obtained from measurements on a patient (e.g. physiologic signals) or the environment are processed by machine learning techniques to update a patient model. Based on the current state of the model, efficient signal processing techniques can be applied to control the application. In this general framework, my research interest concerns the design of in situ adaptive systems, currently focusing on tuning hearing rehabilitation algorithms to the specific preferences of the end user.

Shot Biography

Prof. Bert de Vries received M.Sc. (1986) and Ph.D. (1991) degrees in Electrical Engineering from [Eindhoven University of Technology][0] (TU/e) and the [University of Florida][3], respectively. From 1992 until 1999 he worked at[Sarnoff Research Center][4] in Princeton (NJ), where he contributed to research projects over a wide range of signal and image processing topics such as word spotting, financial market prediction and breast cancer detection from mammograms. Since April 1999 he has been employed in the hearing aids industry (currently at [GN ReSound][1]), both as a _Principal Scientist _and also as a research manager. Since January 2012 he is also a _(part-time) full Professor _in _Personalization of Medical Signal Processing Systems _in the [Signal Processing Systems Group][5] at TU/e, where he teaches the course [Adaptive Information Processing][6] to graduate electrical engineering students. He is an associate editor for the [IEEE Transactions on Neural Sciences and Rehabilitation Engineering][7]. His current research interests focus on developing Bayesian machine learning techniques for efficient tuning of hearing aids to the personal preferences of end users.
